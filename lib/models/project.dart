    title: 'Northern House',
    description:
        'The house is preserved in two different phases. In the early phase the rectangular building measures ca. 106m EW x 45m NS, is mainly built with limestones and beachrocks, is built around at least 4 (?) central main courtyards surrounded by a number of rooms fulfilling different functions. A portico is commonly found along the southern length of the courtyards providing a shaded area. Entrance halls are often elaborated using gypsum plastered interior walls and decorative elements in the plaster of door frames. A sharp bend at the end of the hall ensured that the courtyard areas were shielded from direct view, either from the hallway or from the street outside. Other common rooms are hammams, rooms used for reception, cooking, and food preparation area, and for storage. In the late phase the building is strongly reduced in size in comparison to the older phase (see hatched walls in the building plan). The late Northern House is built on top of the western half of the previous building re-using several main walls; it measures ca. 35 x 45m. Four main spaces were identified, but the complete plan remains speculative; clear are only two small rooms, one at the southeastern corner (6.6 x 3.5m) with a sandy floor built on top of the entrance to the southern vestibule of the early Northern House, and a second room at the southwestern corner (6 x 3.5m) also with a sandy floor.',

    title: 'Lejmail',
    description:
        'Abondoned village of Jumail (Lejmail). More than 30 ruined/ buried structural features visible Settlement of Jumail (Lejmail), abandoned mid-late 20th century. No evidence of the pre-20th century. Heavy reconstruction has destroyed site.An abandoned and reconstructed village on the coast. Upon visual inspection the village seems to be in a fairly poor condition  with a large number of collapsed buildings and modern anthropogenic destructive activities including graffiti, poor reconstructive work using modern and unsympathetic materials, rubbish dumping and camping. Erosion towards the seaward side is fairly severe. Site is protected by fence but this can be circumvented by going on the beach which can be seen to be the case',

    title: 'Ain Mohammad',
    description:
        'Settlement (Late Ottoman (c.1800 - c.1916 CE))Ain Mohammed. The village consists of 24 buildings including 2 mosques. Due to the variety of building material and building styles it is suggested that the village holds 3 different types of buildings and hence suggests 3 different periods of construction. Building type 1 is made of concrete breeze blocks filled with compact sandy beach soils with walls covered with mud plaster - the roof is either flat or pointed. Building type 2 is made of stones and mud plaster covering the walls with either flat or pointed roof and what seemed to be window and door frames made with breeze blocks. Building type 3 seems to resemble building type 2 with stones and mud plastering but, as the majority of these houses have collapsed, it is impossible to make clear suggestions concerning roof etc. The village also holds a courtyard fenced with a stone wall with walls still standing at a maximum height of 77cm. In the courtyard is a smaller orchard or field system and a well with the pump in situ. In the outer courtyard there is an outline of a tent set up with rock with petroglyphs as seen on the aeolionit sand dunes of survey zone 1. The tent set up has a possibe prayer niche. The 2 mosques represent 2 different building types, 1 & 3. Roof seems to be made of timber. Dimensions: Approx extent of site: 49,722.75sq.m. 287m long - NS orientation 173.25m wide - EW orientation',
