Groundtruthing 2013 (Ev207); HAR10069 is a large coastal settlement, consisting of multiple structural features relating to compounds and individual structures as well as extensive archaeological deposits relating to occupation and dumping. The structural features are visible as linear and rectilinear outlines of aeolian sands and medium unbonded limestone rock (locally sourced) all are deflated with several having been damaged by vehicles, as have the underlying archaeological deposits which have been eroded/exposed by viewing traffic and are now subject to natural erosion. The site itself extends much further along the coast that the current site extents [this has now been corrected in the HER], a diffuse linear spread of structures culminated in another nucleated settlement area some 450m west of the currently polygon site. A general scatter of pottery and other artifacts continues from the site at least 600m inland forming a hinterland of anthropological activity.",

Groundtruthing 2014 (Ev207); An abandoned and reconstructed village on the coast. Upon visual inspection the village seems to be in a fairly poor condition with a large number of collapsed buildings and modern anthropogenic destructive activities including graffiti, poor reconstructive work using modern and unsympathetic materials, rubbish dumping and camping. Erosion towards the seaward side is fairly severe. Site is protected by fence but this can be circumvented by going on the beach which can be seen to be the case. It is recommended better protection is put in place and restoration is clearly demarcated. British Mission surveyed the site in 1973 under the direction of B. De Cardi.",

        "Ruwaida is one of the largest archaeological sites in northern Qatar, stretching for more than 2km along the beach of a shallow bay. The beach is covered with a dense growth of mangrove trees and bushes that obscure an ancient water channel which once connected the site to the open sea. Although very little is known about the site from historical sources and the only two historical references both indicate that it was abandoned by the end of the 18th century, Ruwaida stands out from the other historic settlements along the northern coasts of Qatar because its origins can be traced to the 1600’s and possibly back to the medieval period. The only source for understanding the origins, growth and eventual abandonment of the site comes from archaeological research.The first excavations at Ruwaida were carried in out in 2009 by the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David on behalf of the Qatar Museums Authority. Since then a series of excavations have revealed a large fortress (HAR10084), an excavated mosque (HAR10085), two buildings identified as potential mosques (one inside the fort and one on the west side of the settlement), two wells, several warehouses (HAR10083), a ship repair shop, a walled tomb as well as remains of numerous temporary structures. At the western limits of the site there are two cemeteries with graves of both children and adults marked by simple stone outlines. The eastern end of the site contains some rock carvings similar to those found at other sites around the coast of northern Qatar. Particularly worth mentioning is the garden which formed the centerpiece of the Phase II fortress. It is not yet clear if the large, rock-cut feature which formed the basis for the garden, was specially constructed, or whether it was a modified natural feature or a quarry for the limestone used in the Phase I fortress. The garden is located immediately below the contour line at which two of the wells or Ruwaida are located. The larger of the wells is located next to the round tower and may have been excavated as a water source for the garden. In any case, even today the garden area continues to receive and collect fresh water, partially from rain and partially from the aquifer. A functioning garden would have likely produced agricultural products for the inhabitants of the site. Ruwaida is the diminutive of the Arabic term rawda, which locally refers to the shallow depressions or green areas used by Bedouin to pasture their sheep. The name therefore seems appropriate for a settlement which incorporates a garden, or at least a meadow, right in the centre. So far the excavations have mainly identified material from the 17th and 18th centuries although there may be an earlier component to the site. Finds from the sea indicate far-reaching trade contacts with porcelain cups from China, Japan and Myanmar (Burma), unglazed earthenware from Julfar (the United Arab Emirates) and Bahrain, glazed earthenware and stone paste fritware from Iran (e.g. ARC.2010.8.239, ARC.2011.8.1111) as well as ceramics from Europe. The rooms of the fortress were roofed with mangrove poles likely to have originated in Africa. Significant finds recovered from the site include a red granite grinding bowl (ARC.2010.8.232) probably from Iran and a piece of bone carved in the form of an oryx (ARC.2013.8.5).",

        "Aarkyat Fort is located close to the north-west coastal area of Qatar along the road between Zubarah and Madinat Al-Shamal. The exact date of the original construction is unknown but coins and other artefacts found on the site date the fort back to at least 200 years sometime during the 18th century. Ruins of buildings at the nearby Zubarah town indicate that it was a thriving place by 1765 and evidence suggests that Aarkyat Fort dates back to the same period. The name Aarkyat means ''water wells'' (the plural form in Arabic), so it was likely that Aarkyat Fort was built to protect sources of water. There was in fact a water well at the fort that was 5 metres deep. There are ruins of a village close to the fort so there is no doubt that the fort was intended to protect the local inhabitants' water supply. Aarkyral Fort is roughly rectangular in shape measuring approx. 22 metres x 38 metres with corner turrets extending 2 to 3 metres beyond these dimensions. It is laid out in a typical military fort style with narrow rooms arranged in linear fashion around three sides in a large central sand/earth courtyard. The only entrance is a 2.8 metre break in the one metre-thick wall. The exterior walls surrounding Aarkyat Fort are relatively low as military forts go - averaging about 3 metres high. Another striking feature of the fort is the total absence of architectural ornamentation - it is very plain, unadorned, utilitarian structure making it a classic piece of straightforward military architecture. The only distinctive feature of the fort is the crenellated circular turret at the south-west corner, which is slightly more than 7.5 metres in diameter rising about a metre higher than the adjacent west exterior wall and 2 metres higher than the south wall - there are three rectangular turrets at the three other corners of the fort. Each fort each has one or more very small square openings (less than .2 metres wide) situated on their upper extent which although primarily intended to be used as gun holes also allow air and light to enter the turrets' interior. All the turrets (except the south-eastern one) can be accessed by an outside stairway. Strangely the north-eastern stairway only arrives halfway up the wall. About a dozen rooms align three sides of the courtyard none of which have windows. The larger rooms were used as a barracks for soldiers whereas the smaller rooms were used for the storage ammunition and other goods. Just outside the main entrance, adjacent to the large circular turret at the south-western corner, there is a Mosque. The existing shape of the fort seems to be the result of an expansion of the original fort, doubling the size of the courtyard to it's present size. The remains of the original walls can still be seen stretchin acorss the middle of the courtyard and the clear remains of walls, that used to line the east wall, are still visible. The fort was constructed using traditional materials, primarily horizontal layers of rock, covered over with thick layers of mud plaster. Some walls particularly along the front are constructed with adobe brick which is not commonly used in Qatar despite its greater strength and durability. The roof over the courtyard rooms are all constructed using the traditional ''Danshal'' wood beams, overlain with ''Basgiil'' and ''Mangharour'' all of which are overlain with a layer of rocks and then a layer of mud plaster ''tanqa al-tin'' There are Marsams along the outer parapet walls. The fort was renovated in 1988 after falling into a serious state of ruin (photographs from 1974 show the fort in a badly decayed state). Survey 2011 (HAC71) This site comprises the fort and an adjacent mosque. The fort has a rectangular plan and three rectangular towers and one round tower. There are two courtyards one to the east and one to the west divided by a range of rooms. It is not clear whether originally this was a square fort that was later extended or whether the courtyard was divided intwo by later development. Unfortunately because the fort has been thoroughly restored it is not possible to determine the sequence of construction. Groundtruthing 2011 (HAC40): Restored fort. Limestone and mudbrick construction. Three square towers and one round tower/ small camel farm adjacent. Earlier, unrestored walls visible inside and in front of restored fort. Ceramics recovered: SU 528.",

        "Around the fort of Al Thaghab are ruins of a settlement, mostly to the north. The British survey in 1973 recorded a number of small houses built of rough stone masonry set into the ground and distributed on three sides of the 19th century fort, extending from it for about 80m in each direction. Groundtruthing 2010 (HAC40): cluster of 48 collapsed structural features, all circular in plan and with an average diameter of 5m. These features surround the fort at Qalaat al Thaghab (HAR10143) on its north, east and south sides. They were probably also present on the west side of the fort but there is now a large modern farm occupying that area. Waypoints 37-83 correspond to the centre points of the features. At least a percentage of these features were contemporary with the fort (HAR10143).",

        "Settlement site, at least partially ruined and abandoned. Substantial number of structures visible. Ain Mohammed is located 4km from Al Zubarah. The village dates from the 19th century but it is now abandoned and in ruins. The buildings in the village are totally in ruins, with little left of their former architecture and structure. There is northing remaining to show the basic design, apart from some low piles of rocks that suggest walls. Groundtruthing 2011 (HAC40); 20th century abandoned settlement. Probably abandoned in the late 20th century. Most buildings with walls standing to their original height. Modern building material used in most houses. Probably associated with cemetery (QNHER10190). Number of wells associated with this settlement. Groundtruthing 2010 (HAC40): Site 10192 is identified as an abandoned village; Ain Mohammed. The village consists of 24 buildings including 2 mosques. Due to the variety of building material and building styles it is suggested that the village holds 3 different types of buildings and hence suggests 3 different periods of construction. Building type 1 is made of concrete breeze blocks filled with compact sandy beach soils with walls covered with mud plaster - the roof is either flat or pointed. Building type 2 is made of stones and mud plaster covering the walls with either flat or pointed roof and what seemed to be window and door frames made with breeze blocks. Building type 3 seems to resemble building type 2 with stones and mud plastering but, as the majority of these houses have collapsed, it is impossible to make clear suggestions concerning roof etc. The village also holds a courtyard fenced with a stone wall with walls still standing at a maximum height of 77cm. In the courtyard is a smaller orchard or field system and a well with the pump in situ. In the outer courtyard there is an outline of a tent set up with rock with petroglyphs as seen on the aeolionit sand dunes of survey zone 1. The tent set up has a possibe 'prayer# niche. The 2 mosques represent 2 different building types, 1 & 3. Roof seems to be made of timber. Dimensions: Approx extent of site: 49,722.75sq.m. 287m long - NS orientation 173.25m wide - EW orientation",

        "Poorly preserved remains of a possible linear settlement. Series of nearly square and rectangular structures with a NE to SW orientation, built with limestone, few single units and some multi-room units with courtyards. Multiple structures visible of varying sizes. The settlement dimensions are approx. 146 x 96m (14,016sq.m). Recovered ceramics: SU 537 Groundtruthing 2011 (HAC40): Area of ruined structures survive as low mounds of stone, originally limestone walls. A single standing building is associated with ruin of Ain Mohammad. Other walls consist of courtyards and smaller roms. Unclear of this represents an earlier settlement or poorly built mudbrick buildings associated with settlement Ain Mohammad. Modern rubble has been dumped on the site. Earlier islamic glazed sherds hint at earlier occupation. Groundtruthing 2010 (HAC40): An abandoned small settlement situated to the south of abandoned settlement HAR10192 (Ain Mohammed). The site is comprised of a series of small enclosures with buildings with some smaller square buildings to the west. The majority of the walls are between 0.40m - 0.50m wide and 0.40m high. There is only one standing structure situated on the east side of the site which may be later in date. There is a possible burial cairn which markers within one of the courtyards?",
